## My Process
### Design
I created this design on figma. I was going for a clean and minimalist design. And, in addition, I  wanted to add some animation, which I was able to do for some of the buttons.

### Purpose
I wanted to become more familiar with redux and redux-thunk middleware and just try out new techniques I hadn't used before, like context and custom hooks.
